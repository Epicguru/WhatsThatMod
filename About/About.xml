  <description>Do you have too many mods installed? Keep wondering which mod a particular item, animal or weapon comes from?

This mod solves this by adding the name of the mod to every item, building, animal, recipe etc. that the mod adds.

Highly customizable, change the size, color, position etc. of the mod label.
You can also filter out certain mods.

Load as late (low down) as possible.</description>
